Live Lecture feedback Webapp

Idea :
- live feedback as the lecture proceeds
- mood voting system, let the lecturer know if the class understands, if it's going too fast or too slow, etc 
- anonymous question submission during lecture, (chatroom?)
- synchronized slide display
- students can write notes along 
- summary of the lecture can be uploaded/downloaded
- user accounts for students/lecturers, allowing access to corresponding classes, and save their own notes and questions
- pc and mobile compatible
